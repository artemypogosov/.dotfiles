;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones: doom-font, doom-variable-pitch-font, doom-big-font
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:

;; >>> FONTS
;; ‘doom-font’ – standard monospace font that is used for most things in Emacs.
;; ‘doom-variable-pitch-font’ – variable font which is useful in some Emacs plugins.
;; ‘doom-big-font’ – used in doom-big-font-mode; useful for presentations.
;; ‘font-lock-comment-face’ – for comments.
;; ‘font-lock-keyword-face’ – for keywords with special significance like ‘setq’ in elisp.

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.
